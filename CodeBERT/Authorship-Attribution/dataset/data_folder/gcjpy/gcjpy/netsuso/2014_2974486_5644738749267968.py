 # Strategies:
 # 0. Sort both lists of block weights
 # Deceitful War:
 # 1. Walk through her own blocks from the lightest to the heaviest one
 # 2. If the block is lighter than the lightest one from Ken, Naomi will tell a weight slightly lower than Ken's biggest one. So Ken wins, but he loses his heaviest block
 # 3. If the block is heavier than the lightest one from Ken, Naomi will tell a weight slightly higher than Ken's heaviest block. So Naomi wins, and Ken loses his lightest block
 # Standard War:
 # 1. Walk through her own blocks from the heaviest to the lightest one (there's no difference in the order for the result, but this way it's easier to compare)
 # 2. If the block is heavier than the heaviest one from Ken, Naomi wins, and Ken loses his lightest block
 # 3. If the block is lighter than the heaviest one from Ken, Ken wins, and Ken loses his heaviest block
